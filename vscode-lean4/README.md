# Lean 4 VS Code Extension
This extension provides VS Code support for the Lean 4 theorem prover and programming language.

## Installing Lean 4

After installing this extension, a 'Welcome' page with a setup guide should open automatically. The setup guide provides platform-specific information on the following topics:
- Books and documentation resources
- Installing dependencies that are needed by Lean
- Installing Lean's version manager Elan and a recent stable version of Lean 4
- Setting up a Lean 4 project
- Troubleshooting issues

If the setup guide does not open automatically, you can still open it manually by opening an empty file, clicking on the ∀-symbol in the top right and selecting 'Documentation…' > 'Docs: Show Setup Guide'.

## Using this extension

The [Lean 4 VS Code extension manual](https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/blob/master/vscode-lean4/manual/manual.md) provides a complete and detailed overview over all features provided by this VS Code extension. If you are new to Lean, you may find the first five subsections of the 'Interacting with Lean files' section in the manual to be very helpful.
