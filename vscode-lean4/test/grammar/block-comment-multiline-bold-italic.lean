-- Pins the deliberate trade-off documented in MEMORY.md (Zulipchat 573942750
-- fix): bold/italic markdown spans inside Lean comments are NOT allowed to
-- span multiple lines. The `bold` and `italic` end patterns in
-- `lean4-markdown.json` carry an `|(?=$|-/)` clause so they close at end
-- of line or at the start of a `-/` doc-comment terminator.
--
-- Without this, a bold opener whose closer landed on the next line would
-- swallow text across the line boundary, and (worse) a same-line bold
-- whose closer was supposed to match `-/` would consume the doc-comment
-- terminator and keep the block comment open.
