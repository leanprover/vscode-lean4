// `runCliTests.mjs`, `runWdio.mjs` and `runAllTests.mjs` in the root).
//
// If a run script gets SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGHUP, it passes the signal on to
// all processes of its child, waits until the child ends, and then ends with
// the same signal. Else VS Code can keep running on the test home, and the
// next run deletes the test home while VS Code still uses it. On Linux and
// macOS, the child gets its own process group, so that the signal also reaches
// processes that do not pass it on (for example `xvfb-run`). As a result, the
// SIGHUP of a closed terminal reaches only the run script, and not the group
// of the child. Windows has no such signals: there, Ctrl-C reaches all
// processes of the console.
