## Installing Required Dependencies
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win). You can keep all settings in the installer at their default values.
2. Wait until the installation has completed.
3. Restart VS Code and re-open this guide.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a commonly used [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) that is used by Lean to help manage different versions of Lean formalization packages and software packages.

## Restricted Environments
If you are in an environment where you cannot install Git and it is not already installed, for example on a restricted university computer, there is currently no option to try Lean 4 with a local installation. If you want to try out Lean 4 regardless, you can read [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) and do the exercises with [an online instance of Lean 4 hosted using Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean). Doing so requires creating a GitHub account.
