## Elan
[Elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) automatically manages all the different versions of Lean and ensures that the correct version is used when opening a project.

Clicking [this link](command:lean4.setup.installElan) will download the [Elan setup script](https://github.com/leanprover/elan/blob/master/elan-init.ps1) and execute it.

If the script executes without displaying an error, Elan has successfully been installed. If it displays an error that you do not understand, click on the 'Questions and Troubleshooting' step on the left.
