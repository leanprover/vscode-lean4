## Installing Required Dependencies
1. [Open a new terminal](command:workbench.action.terminal.new).
2. Depending on your Linux distribution, do one of the following to install Git and curl using your package manager:
    * On Ubuntu and Debian, type in `sudo apt install git curl` and press Enter.
    * On Fedora, type in `sudo dnf install git curl` and press Enter.
    * If you are not sure which Linux distribution you are using, you can try both.
3. When prompted, type in your login credentials.
4. Wait until the installation has completed.

## Dependencies Needed by Lean 4
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a commonly used [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) that is used by Lean to help manage different versions of Lean formalization packages and software packages.

[curl](https://curl.se/) is a small tool to transfer data that is used by Lean to download files when managing Lean formalization packages and software packages.

## Restricted Environments
If you are in an environment where you cannot install Git or curl, for example a restricted university computer, you can check if you already have them installed by [opening a new terminal](command:workbench.action.terminal.new), typing in `which git curl` and pressing Enter. If the terminal output displays two file paths and no error, you already have them installed.  

If your machine does not already have Git and curl installed and you cannot install them, there is currently no option to try Lean 4 with a local installation. If you want to try out Lean 4 regardless, you can read [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) and do the exercises with [an online instance of Lean 4 hosted using Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean). Doing so requires creating a GitHub account. Alternatively, you can also [play the Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/hhu-adam/NNG4) or [try a single-file version of Lean 4 in your web browser](https://live.lean-lang.org/).
