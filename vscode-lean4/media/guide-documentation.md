## Books
If you want to learn Lean 4, choose one of the following introductory books based on your background. If you are getting stuck or have any questions, click on the 'Questions and Troubleshooting' step below.

- [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/)  
  The standard introduction for using Lean 4 as a general-purpose programming language.
- [The Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/)  
  An introduction to Lean 4 as an interactive theorem prover for anyone who also wants to learn how to write rigorous mathematical proofs.
- [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/)  
  The standard introduction to Lean 4 as an interactive theorem prover for users with a mathematics background.
- [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/)  
  The standard reference for using Lean 4 as an interactive theorem prover. Suited as an introduction for users with a computer science background, advanced users and for general use as a reference manual.

Once you have completed one of these books and its exercises, you are ready to use Lean 4 for your own projects. If you want to use Lean 4 both as a general-purpose programming language and an interactive theorem prover, it is recommended to read both [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/) and [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/).

## Hands-On Tutorial
If you want to dive right into using Lean 4 to prove elementary theorems about natural numbers, you can play the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/hhu-adam/NNG4). It can be played online using your browser without a local installation.
