## Books
If you want to learn Lean 4, choose one of the following introductory books based on your background. If you are getting stuck or have any questions, click on the 'Questions and Troubleshooting' step below.

- [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/)  
  The standard reference for using Lean 4 as an interactive theorem prover. Suited as an introduction for users with a computer science background, advanced users and for general use as a reference manual.
- [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/)  
  The standard introduction to Lean 4 as an interactive theorem prover for users with a mathematics background.
- [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/)  
  The standard introduction for using Lean 4 as a general-purpose programming language.

Once you have completed one of these books and its exercises, you are ready to use Lean 4 for your own projects. If you want to use Lean 4 both as an interactive theorem prover and as a general-purpose programming language, it is recommended to read both [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/) and [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/).

## Hands-On Tutorial
If you want to dive right into using Lean 4 to prove elementary theorems about natural numbers, you can play the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/hhu-adam/NNG4). It can be played online using your browser without a local installation.

## Documentation
**Metaprogramming**  
[Metaprogramming in Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-metaprogramming-book) is an introduction to the metaprogramming facilities of Lean 4 that can be used to write theorem proving automation, adjust Lean 4 and extend Lean 4. Should only be read after [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/).

**Type System**  
If you are a type theorist and want to learn the details of the type theory underlying Lean 4, you can read [The Type Theory of Lean](https://github.com/digama0/lean-type-theory/releases/download/v1.0/main.pdf) by Mario Carneiro for a formal description of the type theory of Lean 3, which is largely identical to that of Lean 4. The few aspects that have changed between Lean 3 and Lean 4 are described in section 3.2 of [An Extensible Theorem Proving
Frontend](https://lean-lang.org/papers/thesis-sebastian.pdf) by Sebastian Ullrich.

**Architecture**  
Many elements of the architecture of Lean 4, for example its macro system, its do-notation, its reference counting garbage collection and the different components which Lean 4 is composed of are described in [An Extensible Theorem Proving
Frontend](https://lean-lang.org/papers/thesis-sebastian.pdf) by Sebastian Ullrich.

**Manual**  
The [Lean Manual](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/) is a loose collection of details on Lean 4.
