## Books
If you want to learn Lean 4, choose one of the following introductory books based on your background. If you are getting stuck or have any questions, click on the 'Questions and Troubleshooting' step at the bottom on the left side.

- [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/)  
  The standard introduction to using Lean 4 as a general-purpose programming language. Suited for all users who wish to learn how to use Lean 4 as a programming language.
- [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4/)  
  The standard introduction to using Lean 4 as an interactive theorem prover for users with a computer science background. Also suited for advanced users as a bottom-up introduction to Lean 4.
- [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/)  
  The standard introduction to using Lean 4 as an interactive theorem prover for users with a mathematics background. Also suited for all users who wish to learn the basics of how to use [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4), Lean's math library.
- [The Lean Language Reference](https://lean-lang.org/doc/reference/latest/)  
  The reference manual of Lean 4. Suited for all users who need a comprehensive and precise description of any Lean 4 feature.

## Hands-On Tutorial
If you want to dive right into using Lean 4 to prove elementary theorems about natural numbers, you can play the [Natural Number Game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/NNG4), which uses a simplified dialect of Lean 4. It can be played online using your browser without a local installation.

## Using Lean 4 in VS Code
The [Lean 4 VS Code extension manual](command:lean4.docs.showExtensionManual) covers all kinds of essential tools when working with Lean 4 in VS Code. Even if you are already familiar with other programming languages and VS Code in general, you may still find the first five subsections of the 'Interacting with Lean files' section in the manual to be very helpful. The manual covers several essential Lean-specific VS Code features, e.g. how to work with multiple Lean files, how to use the InfoView in VS Code and how to input Unicode characters.

## Additional Resources
**Website**  
[Lean's website](https://lean-lang.org/) provides information on further resources for Lean 4 itself and the Lean community.

**Lean Community**  
The [Lean community website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/index.html) links to several other helpful learning resources not listed here and provides an introduction to [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4), Lean's math library.

**Lean Zulip**  
The [Lean Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/) is the primary forum of discussion for all topics and questions related to Lean.

**Reservoir**  
[Reservoir](https://reservoir.lean-lang.org/) indexes all public Lean packages and provides information on Lean version compatibility, package dependencies and package dependents.

## Finding Definitions and Theorems
A complete API reference for Lean 4 and [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4), Lean's math library, can be found on the [Mathlib documentation page](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/).

Additionally, there are multiple search engines that help you find definitions and theorems in Lean 4 and Mathlib:

- [Loogle](command:lean4.loogle.search): A pattern-based search engine that finds definitions and theorems by type signature or by the names of their identifiers.
- [LeanExplore](https://www.leanexplore.com/) and [LeanSearch](https://leansearch.net/): Two AI-based search engine that find definitions and theorems by a description in natural language.
